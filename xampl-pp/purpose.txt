Implementations of an XML pull parser in several programming languages
including Ruby and SmallEiffel.

Pull parsers are streaming XML parsers that are very low level (you can
build a SAX-like parser using these).  They tend to be very fast with
simple APIs.

I am unaware of any implementation of pull parsers in either Ruby
or Eiffel (there are at least three Java implemenations).

Both Ruby and SmallEiffel share a limitation in that they assume 8-bit
characters, but place no limitations on the values of those characters.
This presents some difficulty when dealing with multi-byte character
encodings. The xampl pull parsers will handle this limitation in a way
that is manageable in the various implementation languages.
